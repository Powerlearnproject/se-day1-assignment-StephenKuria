#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications using structured principles, methodologies, and best practices.
 security- Helps in implementing protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.
 Flexibility- it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
 Reliability-Software engeneering ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance.
 Building High-Quality Software-Software engineering ensures that applications are functional, scalable, secure, and efficient.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity-s software systems grew larger, managing complexity became a major challenge where Early software was often written in an unstructured way, making it difficult to debug, modify, or scale.
Mastering process-oftware development followed the Waterfall Model, which required all planning, design, and coding to be completed before testing which often led to delays and inflexible software.
Mastering machine-It later advanced where developers needed to optimize performance, scalability, and resource management across machines and networks.




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope
Analysis- Analyzing the final user specification
design - building the framework. 
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on ie Testing is done at the end of the development process while agile methodology is Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles ie Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Writing Code: Develops applications using programming languages like Java, Python
Software Design: Implements system architecture, databases, and APIs.
Debugging & Troubleshooting: Identifies and fixes software bugs and performance issues.
Continuous Learning: Stays updated with new technologies and frameworks.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks
An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand
The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challanges
rapid technological advancement
Limited Infrastructure
Changing Software Requirements
Strategies
Using scalable architecture
Emphasizing reliability.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

 Integration tests - they verify that different modules or services used by an application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focuses on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests -they are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Defination: prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance
Improved user experience - it makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt-Create a website for my business.
Improved-Design a responsive e-commerce website for my fashion brand. The site should include a homepage, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout page. Use a modern, minimalist design with a black and white color scheme. Ensure it is mobile-friendly and integrates with PayPal for payments.
Clarity: Specifies that the website is for an e-commerce fashion brand.
Functionality: Highlights essential features like mobile responsiveness and PayPal integration.
Scope Definition: Lists the key pages needed (homepage, catalog, cart, checkout).
